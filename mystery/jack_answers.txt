Step 1
Challenge - How can you view a file in different directory without switching to that directory first? What is the difference between absolute paths and relative paths.
1. you write the path address form the directory you are in, e.g. ./directory1/sub-directory/file (allows you to access files from the current directory down a few subdirectories), or ../alt_directory/filename (allows you to step up a directory and then go into a different directory or ~/directory/filename (takes you straight to the root directory and search from there.
2. Absolute path will be the full path title from the root, relative path will be the route from the current directory.
